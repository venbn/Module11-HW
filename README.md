## Dev

The code has been written in Python using Google colab. To execute the code, the file "forecasting_net_prophet.ipynb" needs to be uploaded to colab.research.google.com.

Open "colab.research.google.com" and login using your gmail id, then upload the ipynb file and then the code can be viewed and executed. 

## Pre-requisites

should be able to access and use Google colab and the below files must be available to ensure the code will be able to upload the following files on to Google drive to execute the code. 

google_hourly_search_trends.csv
mercado_daily_revenue.csv
mercado_stock_price.csv

## Execution process

Logon to colab.researh.google.com
Upload the Jupyter notebook forecasting_net_prophet.ipynb
Start executing the code by running each cell in sequence

To view the code on the system..

Clone the directory which contains all the .csv files and the .ipynb file to your system using the following commands

git clone https://github.com/venbn/Module11-HW.git

Once the clone completes.. 

Go to the directory "Module11-HW"

cd Module11-HW

Execute 'Jupyter notebook' command
